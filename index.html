        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I'm originally from Georgia. I started coding 2D platformer games when I was in
          middle school. From then on, I was hooked. I took web design classes
          throughout Highschool and went on to study Software Development in
          college. I graduated from Georgia Gwinnett College in 4 years and got
          a job for a small company called
          <a href="https://www.worldwontwait.com">worldwontwait.com</a>. I spent
          a year there writing low and high level requirements-based tests for
          a larger company. After that I decided I wanted to get back into
          writing code. So I moved to Brooklyn, and here we are.

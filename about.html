                <h2>This is me!</h2>
                <p>I am currently a software development student attending Georgia Gwinnett College. I've been attending GGC for 3 years now. Some of my skills include web development, application design and writing <strong>TONS</strong> of papers.</p>
                <h2>Some things about me</h2>
                <p>I love playing video games. I especially love games that provide a challenge in some way. Whether it be a puzzle, or a grueling boss battle (Dark Souls), I just can't stay away.</p>
                <p>I also like to watch anime. Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood used to be my favorite
                anime would have to be the new series One Punch Man! I love Saitama and I connect with him in his quest to find something that makes his time worthwhile.</p>
                <p>Another obvious hobby of mine is web development and application design. Most of my projects are school-related. Even this website is a school project. Sue me, I'm a student. There isn't much time for me to develop between work and
                school hours.</p>
                <p>That about sums up everything I think should go on this page. If you have any questions feel free to contact me at <a id="mail" href="mailto:mwilkinson@ggc.edu">mwilkinson@ggc.edu</a>. </p>
                <h2>Cheers,</h2>
